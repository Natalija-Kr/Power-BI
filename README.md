#### In the project many various DAX formulas were used (some of them below):
1.	Total Sales = SUM('Sales'[Sales Amount])
2.	Total units sold = SUM(Sales[Order Quantity])
3.	Gross profit = [Total Sales]-[Total product cost]
4.	Total products sold = DISTINCTCOUNT('Sales'[ProductKey])
5.	Total product cost = SUM(Sales[Total Product Cost])
6.	Sales per product = DIVIDE([Total Sales],[Total products sold])
7.	Products in stock = COUNT('Product'[ProductKey])
8.	Increase Sales = [Total Sales]*Parameter_What_if[Parameter Value]+[Total Sales]
9.	Active sales = INT ( NOT ISEMPTY ( Sales) )
